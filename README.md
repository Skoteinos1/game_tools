# Bots and tools for various games

![Picure of Multiple Games](https://github.com/Skoteinos1/game_tools/blob/main/Games.jpg) 

There are times when rewards are more interesting than game itself. You really shouldn't use this stuff. If they catch you, you don't have it from me. Capisce? 

Warframe - Just little bit of help with daily grind. Automates some stuff, helps build better weapons, finds best levels for grinding.<br>
EVE - Uses EVE's API to look for undervalued contracts. Also can estimate hidden end of auctions. And best thing, Autopilot for your ship is included.<br>
Urban Rivals - With good deck can achieve 45% win rate against humans. Can go through rift while you sleep all by itself.<br>
