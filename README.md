Bots and tools for various games



Warframe - Just little bit of help with daily grind. Automates some stuff, helps build better weapons, finds best levels for grinding.
EVE - Uses EVE's API to look for undervalued contracts. Also can estimate hidden end of auctions. And best thing, Autopilot for your ship is included. If they catch you, you don't have it from me. Capisce?
Urban Rivals - When rewards are more interesting than game itself. With good deck can achieve 45% win rate against humans. Can go through rift while you sleep all by itself. Again, if they catch you, you never heard of me.
